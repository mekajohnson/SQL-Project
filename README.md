Menu Optimization Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer data from a mock restaurant to evaluate the performance of new menu items introduced at the beginning of the year. Leveraging SQL queries, the analysis delves into customer preferences, identifies popular and unpopular menu items, and provides insights for menu optimization.

Key Features
Exploration of Menu Items Table: Querying the menu items table to understand the composition of the menu, including the number of items, least and most expensive items, quantity of items in each category, and average prices within categories.

Understanding Order Details: Analyzing the order details table to gain insights into customer orders, including order ID, date, time, and item details.

Identification of Popular and Unpopular Items: Analyzing order details to determine the performance of menu items based on sales volume, revenue generated, and customer feedback metrics.

Customer Preferences Analysis: Investigating customer preferences by analyzing the frequency of orders for each menu item, identifying correlations between items frequently ordered together, and conducting sentiment analysis on customer reviews if available.

Insights and Recommendations: Drawing actionable insights from the analysis to inform decision-making, including recommendations for menu adjustments, pricing strategies, promotion of popular items, and introduction of new dishes.
